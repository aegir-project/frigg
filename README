Frigg is a little script that makes use of libcloud to:

 * Provision a server (by default, in the Rackspace Cloud)
 * Install Aegir on it


Caveats
-------

 * Totally and ruthlessly assumes a Debian based system at the moment. Deployment commands are hardcoded apt-get commands.
 * Needs sanity checking of values in the .ini, and probably elsewhere too.
 * maybe I should make the Aegir URL an arg and not from the ini, to make it faster to pump out Aegir servers


Dependencies
------------

 * python
 * libcloud


Usage
-----

 * edit config/frigg.ini to provide your email address, the aegir URL and version, your api keys etc from your provider
 * python frigg

You'll receive the standard one-time login e-mail for your Aegir installation once completed.

Editing DNS/your hosts file to make the Aegir URL resolvable to the new server's IP is your responsibility.


Supported VPS providers
-----------------------

Theoretically you can use this with any VPS provider supported by libcloud that supports the deploy_node function.

The deploy_node function is a combination of creating a server and running a bunch of commands on it. I believe Amazon EC2 doesn't support it.

According to libcloud's docs, 'Depends on a Provider Driver supporting either using a specific password or returning a generated password.'
