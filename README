Frigg is a little script that makes use of libcloud to:

 * Provision a server (by default, in the Rackspace Cloud)

 * Install Aegir on it


Dependencies
------------

 * python
 * libcloud

Usage
-----

 * edit config/frigg.ini to provide your email address, the aegir URL and version, your api keys etc from your provider
 * python frigg

You'll receive the standard one-time login e-mail for your Aegir installation once completed.

Editing DNS/your hosts file to make the Aegir URL resolvable to the new server's IP is your responsibility.

Supported VPS providers
-----------------------

Theoretically you can use this with any VPS provider supported by libcloud that supports the deploy_node function.

The deploy_node function is a combination of creating a server and running a bunch of commands on it. I believe Amazon EC2 doesn't support it.

According to libcloud's docs, 'Depends on a Provider Driver supporting either using a specific password or returning a generated password.'


TODO
----

 * sanity checking of values provided from the ini and probably elsewhere too
 * maybe make the Aegir URL an arg and not from the ini, to make it faster to pump out Aegir servers
